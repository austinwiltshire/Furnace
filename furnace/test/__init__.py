Tests for the furnace project

REGRESSION style tests simply test that known outputs from the models
Other tests have been hand checked generally using yahoo data. Yahoo data drifts, so usually download at one time
and reuse that data over and over again.

All written in py.test style.
to run,

pip install pytest

in Furnace directory,
>py.test
